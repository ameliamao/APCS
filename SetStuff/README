INTRODUCTION: 
	This is the Setstuff project. It is one class which implements the 11 methods created in codingBat.

SPECIFICATIONS:
	This program fulfills the required specifications. It has tested correctly for all the situations in codingBat. There should
	be no current errors
	
CODE OVERVIEW:
	There is one class containing all the methods called SetStuff.java. Each function in the class is a separate problem in coding bat 
	with the exception of the intersect method which uses a helper method called bubbleSort.
	
CHALLENGES:
	The major challenge I encountered was the nearesUnvisitedNode() class. Originally I created a series of for loops and if statements,
	making the code very long and inefficient. However, after thought to change it, I came up with a way to significantly shorten
	the code to make it much faster.
	
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: 
	Sophia collaborated with me to figure out a better way to implement the nearesUnvisitedNode method.
