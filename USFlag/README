INTRODUCTION: 
	This is the American Flag Project. It is an applet program that generates a flag which is scalable through the cursor. 

SPECIFICATIONS:
	This program fulfills the required specifications. It is both scalable and accurate to the data provided in the specified website.
	There are currently no errors in the code.
	
CODE OVERVIEW:
	There are 3 different classes: Flag, Stars, and Stripes. The Stripes class creates one stripe given the x and y values, 
	a color and the size which the stripe should be. The Stars class calculates and draws an array of 50 stars, that are sized 
	by the blue rectangle(the union), which is communicated through the Flag Class. The Flag Class creates the union and the 13 
	different stripes, generating the complete US flag in an JApplet window.
	
CHALLENGES:
	The major challenge I encountered was calculating the points of a star, and drawing it. I just started trigonometry this year, 
	so I was not able to derive a formula for the star. In the end, I just searched up how to make a star, and was able to find an
	algorithm that I integrated into my code.
	
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: 
	The code I used for my star can be found in this link: https://github.com/triyangle/Flag/blob/master/src/Flag.java
	It is a github file containing code that I used directly for the star calculations.
	I also use https://www.javatpoint.com/java-applet, for reference on how to create my applet.
